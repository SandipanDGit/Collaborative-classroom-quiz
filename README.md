:star: Development in progress

### This single page application(SPA) quiz interface is designed to fetch a set of MCQs from the server [Collaborative classroom API](https://github.com/SandipanDGit/Collaborative-classroom-API) and run the quiz with a countdown timer. 

</br>

This application makes use of vue.js and vuex for state management. Bootstrap is used for styling.

</br>

As of now, it is not hooked with collaborative classroom APIs. It fetches a set of 20 random but interesting questions from [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). There is no authentication as of now, anybody can download and enjoy the quiz with variety of interesting questions.
